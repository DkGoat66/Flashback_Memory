# Flashback_Memory- Your Learning Companion
Flashback Memory is a Python-based application designed to enhance your learning experience by promoting consistent reflection and knowledge retention. With this program, users can log their daily learnings, fostering a habit of reflection and reinforcing their understanding of various topics.

## Features:
### Daily Check-Ins:
Users are prompted to check in three times daily, creating a routine for reflection on their learning experiences.
### Topic Logging:
Each check-in requires users to jot down something about the topic they learned, encouraging active recall and reinforcing knowledge.
### Streak System:
Flashback Memory incorporates a streak system, rewarding users for maintaining a consistent daily check-in routine. The longer the streak, the more motivating the rewards become.
### Weekly Rewards:
Users receive weekly rewards based on their cumulative daily check-ins throughout the week, adding an element of gamification to the learning process.
